================================================================================
Infrastructure, DevOps, and MLOps - How I Make ML Production-Ready

I really believe that infrastructure is just as important as the models, so I've developed solid DevOps and MLOps skills. I use Terraform extensively for infrastructure as code - I've built Terraform modules to automate the provisioning of entire RAG systems, cloud resources, and data pipelines. Infrastructure as code is essential for repeatability and scaling.

For containerization, I work with Docker to create production-ready container solutions. I containerize ML applications, data processing pipelines, and microservices to ensure consistency across development and production environments.

I'm experienced building CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. I set up automated testing, deployment workflows, and continuous integration for both ML models and data pipelines. This means models get deployed reliably, and we catch issues early through automated testing.

On the MLOps side, I handle the full production ML lifecycle: model versioning, automated retraining pipelines, monitoring model performance in production, A/B testing for model validation, and setting up alerting for model drift. I've deployed models that serve hundreds of users and process thousands of requests.

For workflow orchestration, I use Apache Airflow to schedule and monitor data pipelines, coordinate complex workflows, and ensure data processing runs reliably.

CHUNK_07_INDUSTRY_EXPERIENCE_AND_BUSINESS_VALUE
================================================================================
Industries I've Worked In and How I Deliver Business Impact

I've worked across several industries, which has given me a broad perspective on how ML solves real business problems. In the pharmaceutical industry, I spent nearly 3 years building customer analytics solutions for some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies (global Top 3). I built sales forecasting models with 3% error rates, customer segmentation for personalized marketing, and recommendation systems that increased engagement by 7%.
