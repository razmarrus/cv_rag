CHUNK_03_SALES_FORECASTING_PROJECT_PHARMA
================================================================================
Project: Sales Prediction and Forecasting with 3% Error Rate - UK Pharmaceutical Company

I developed a highly accurate sales forecasting model for a UK-based Big Pharma company that achieved just 3% prediction error (WAPE 0.03, R2 0.96) for 4-month ahead sales forecasts. The project involved building a linear time-series model that identified and quantified the most and least valuable factors affecting pharmaceutical sales.

The business value was in identifying key sales drivers including seasonality patterns, historical sales trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness. The model enabled the client to compare different factors influencing sales and make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and marketing spend. This was critical for multi-million dollar budget planning.

I focused heavily on data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns from historical sales data. Through iterative experimentation with model architectures and rigorous validation, I optimized the model for both accuracy and interpretability. The model quantified the impact of each factor, allowing business stakeholders to understand not just what would happen, but why.

The model was deployed into production on AWS infrastructure with Apache Airflow orchestration, enabling automated monthly forecasts with regular model updates as new data became available. This replaced manual forecasting processes that took days with automated predictions delivered in minutes.

CHUNK_04_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_PROJECT_PHARMA
================================================================================
Project: Customer Clustering and Segmentation - 8 Business-Interpretable Segments for Pharmaceutical Marketing

I developed a comprehensive customer segmentation solution for a UK-based Big Pharma company that identified 8 distinct clusters based on customer loyalty and engagement patterns. Each cluster had a clear, actionable development strategy tailored to that segment's unique characteristics, enabling personalized engagement approaches.

I built this customer clustering system from scratch and integrated it into the client's existing infrastructure. The solution combined clustering machine learning algorithms (K-means and Birch) with marketing analytics frameworks (ABC analysis for customer value and RFM analysis for recency, frequency, monetary patterns). This hybrid approach created business-interpretable clusters that made sense to marketing teams rather than just mathematical groupings.

The segmentation enabled personalized engagement strategies for each customer group. Marketing teams could now target high-value loyal customers differently from at-risk churners, new customers differently from long-term inactive accounts. This replaced one-size-fits-all marketing with strategic, segment-specific campaigns that improved engagement and ROI.

The technical implementation involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering combining behavioral and transactional data, algorithm selection and optimization, statistical testing to validate cluster stability, and production deployment with regular cluster updates as customer behaviors evolved.

================================================================================
Project: HR Analytics Data Layer - 28 Raw Tables to 6 Dashboards for ProRail Netherlands

I designed and built a comprehensive business-ready HR data layer in Microsoft Fabric for ProRail, the Dutch national rail infrastructure company. The project transformed 28 complex raw operational tables into 6 clean, analytics-ready dashboards supporting employee history profiles, leave management analytics, and contract tracking.

The business challenge was that HR teams needed workforce insights for critical decisions but couldn't access interpretable data directly. They were dependent on data analysts for routine queries, causing delays in workforce planning. I enabled HR teams to access workforce insights directly without navigating complex raw data structures or waiting for analyst support.

I collaborated closely with Dutch-speaking data analysts and HR stakeholders to understand requirements and design the optimal transformation logic. Using Apache Spark and SQL stored procedures, I built scheduled data pipelines that automated the entire transformation process with daily updates. This replaced manual data aggregation that was time-consuming and error-prone.

The impact was significant: HR queries that previously took days now completed in minutes. HR teams gained self-service analytics capabilities. Analysts were freed from routine queries to focus on strategic work. The system provided daily-updated insights on workforce composition, leave patterns, contract expirations, and employee history for thousands of rail infrastructure employees.

CHUNK_06_IOT_REALTIME_PLATFORM_WATERSCHAP
================================================================================
Project: Real-Time IoT Telemetry Platform for Critical Water Infrastructure - 1000 Messages/Minute Capacity

I developed an enterprise-grade real-time IoT data ingestion and processing platform for Waterschap bedrijf, a Dutch water management authority responsible for critical public safety infrastructure. The system enables 24/7 real-time monitoring of water levels, pump stations, sewage systems, and environmental conditions across entire regions.

The platform handles IoT telemetry data via Azure Event Hub and Function Apps, processing bursts up to 1000 messages per minute while maintaining sub-second latency for critical alerts. I built Terraform-managed infrastructure optimized for variable traffic patterns - efficient during normal operations but automatically scaling for bursts during storms or emergency events.

The business criticality was high: system failures could lead to flooding, environmental damage, or infrastructure breakdowns with serious public safety consequences. I implemented comprehensive data quality management with automated alerts on anomalies, sensor failures, or system issues. This enabled proactive issue detection through immediate notifications on potential emergencies, allowing operators to respond within seconds instead of hours.

The system replaced manual monitoring that couldn't provide 24/7 coverage. It now continuously validates data quality, detects outliers and anomalies in real-time, alerts on threshold breaches for water levels or system health, tracks device status and connectivity, and maintains historical data for analysis and forecasting.

================================================================================
Project: LLM Document Summarization and Q&A - Mistral 8b Fine-tuning for Insurance Documents

I integrated and fine-tuned an LLM solution using Mistral 8b for document summarization and contextual question-answering for an insurance company. The system enabled users to extract specific insights from lengthy domain-specific insurance documents (60+ pages) in seconds rather than hours.

The business challenge was that insurance professionals were spending hours reading through complex policy documents, legal contracts, and claim reports to find specific information. This was inefficient and created bottlenecks in claims processing and policy review workflows. I needed to enable rapid information extraction while maintaining accuracy for regulatory compliance.

I integrated document parsing capabilities and fine-tuned the Mistral 8b model specifically for insurance domain terminology and document structures. The system could summarize entire documents, answer specific questions about policy terms, extract key clauses, and provide contextual explanations of complex insurance concepts.
