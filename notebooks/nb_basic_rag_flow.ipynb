    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using classes from src directory. The implementation is divided into individual pipeline stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document Processing: Token-aware chunking with overlap\n",
    "2. Embedding Generation: Semantic vectorization\n",
    "3. Vector Storage: PostgreSQL + pgvector indexing\n",
    "4. Retrieval: Cosine similarit*y search\n",
    "5. Generation: Context-augmented LLM completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**TextProcessor** - Text segmentation and token budget management.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Token-based chunking (512 tokens, 50 token overlap)\n",
    "* Uses cl100k_base tokenizer for GPT compatibility\n",
    "* Adaptive context assembly within token budgets\n",
    "\n",
    "**HuggingFaceClient** - Embedding generation and LLM inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embeddings: Local sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim)\n",
    "* Generation: Remote Hugging Face Inference API (default: Mistral-7B-Instruct)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PgVectorDB** - PostgreSQL interface with vector similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores embeddings as VECTOR(384) with chunk metadata\n",
    "* Uses ivfflat indexing for approximate nearest neighbor search\n",
    "* Cosine similarity search via <=> operator\n"

Engineering teams were wasting hours on document searches, project timelines were delayed due to information bottlenecks, there was risk of using outdated technical documentation, reduced productivity across departments, difficulty onboarding new employees, and lost institutional knowledge when people left.\\n\\nWhat I Built: I built a comprehensive GPT-based knowledge retrieval system that lets users instantly query SharePoint libraries. I created an internal QA system with more than 30 isolated RAG flows, each serving a specific domain with appropriate security and access controls. I automated the entire document ingestion pipeline from SharePoint to vector database (Pgvector), supporting daily updates across multiple domains. I used Terraform to enable rapid provisioning of new knowledge domains.\\n\\nThe Impact: Information retrieval speed reduced from hours to seconds (100x improvement). The system has 300 weekly active users across 30+ domains, showing strong adoption and clear business value. Engineers save multiple hours per week, there's no more manual searches through entire repositories, knowledge access is democratized across the organization, onboarding time is reduced for new employees, and daily updates ensure the latest information is always available.\\n\\nQ: What was Margot's biggest project?

This was a Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, HR Analytics, and Big Data project in the rail transportation infrastructure industry. All business communications were conducted in Dutch.\\n\\nThe Business Problem: ProRail maintained employee data across 28 raw operational tables with complex relationships and technical structures. HR teams needed workforce insights for critical decisions but couldn't directly access interpretable data. Data analysts were spending significant time responding to ad-hoc HR requests instead of doing strategic analysis. There was no centralized analytics layer for employee history, leave management, and contract tracking. HR teams were dependent on analysts for routine queries, slow response time for workforce planning, difficulty tracking employee history, complicated leave management without clear analytics, contract tracking across multiple systems, no single source of truth for HR metrics, and time-consuming manual reporting.\\n\\nWhat I Built: I designed and implemented a business-ready HR data layer in Microsoft Fabric supporting comprehensive analytics on employee history, leave management, and contract tracking. The goal was to enable HR teams to access workforce insights directly through 6 clean dashboards without navigating complex raw tables. I worked closely with Dutch-speaking data analysts and HR stakeholders to understand requirements and transform the raw data using Apache Spark and SQL stored procedures. I built scheduled pipelines that converted 28 raw operational tables into 6 analytics-ready tables with daily automated updates and data quality checks.\\n\\nThe Impact: I consolidated 28 complex tables into 6 business-friendly dashboards. HR teams gained direct access without analyst intervention. Daily automated updates ensure current information. HR queries reduced from days to minutes. HR teams can answer their own questions independently, accelerating workforce planning. Data quality improved with accuracy and consistency of HR metrics.

The data processing was Spark-based ETL for large-scale transformation. I used SQL stored procedures for complex business logic, scheduled pipelines with daily execution, close partnership with Dutch-speaking analysts and HR teams, automated validation and reconciliation, and Dutch-language documentation for business users.\\n\\nData Architecture: The source layer had 28 raw tables including employee master data, contract information, leave and absence records, historical employment records, position and role tables, department and org structure, compensation and benefits, time tracking records, performance reviews, training and certifications, and multiple auxiliary reference tables.\\n\\nThe transformation layer included Spark jobs for aggregation and joining, complex business logic in stored procedures, employee history timeline construction, leave balance calculations, contract status derivation, data quality checks and validation, slowly changing dimension handling, and incremental processing for efficiency.\\n\\nThe output layer had 6 Analytics Tables: (1) Employee Profile Analytics with comprehensive history and current status, (2) Leave Management Analytics with balances, usage patterns, and forecasting, (3) Contract Analytics with types, durations, renewals, and expirations, (4) Workforce Demographics with age, tenure, and department distribution, (5) Headcount and Movement with hiring, departures, transfers, and trends, and (6) Performance and Compliance with training, certifications, and compliance metrics.\\n\\nSpark Processing Details: I used PySpark for distributed processing, optimized joins across large tables, window functions for time-series analysis, aggregations for metric calculation, partitioning strategy for performance, caching for frequently accessed data, broadcasting for small reference tables, and dynamic partition pruning.\\n\\nTechnical Challenges I Solved: Consolidated complex data from 28 disparate systems, handled multi-year historical employee data, implemented efficient incremental processing for daily updates, designed scalable architecture for growing workforce data, created business-friendly models from technical structures, ensured data quality across complex transformations, optimized Spark jobs for performance at scale, managed slowly changing dimensions for historical accuracy, and implemented robust error handling and recovery.\\n\\nQ: How did Margot transform 28 tables?

This was an IoT, Real-time Data Processing, Telemetry, and Critical Infrastructure project in the water management and utilities industry. All client communications were in Dutch.\\n\\nThe Business Problem: Dutch water management authorities operate critical infrastructure - monitoring water levels, pump stations, sewage systems, and environmental conditions across entire regions. Real-time monitoring is essential for public safety and environmental protection. System failures can lead to flooding, environmental damage, or infrastructure breakdowns with serious consequences.\\n\\nTheir existing systems couldn't handle variable IoT message rates and traffic bursts, had no real-time alerting for emergencies and failures, data quality issues going undetected causing false readings, manual monitoring insufficient for 24/7 operations, delayed response to critical events, scalability limitations during peak events (storms, flooding), no proactive issue detection before failures, and limited visibility into system health. Business risks included public safety threats, environmental damage, infrastructure damage, regulatory compliance issues, reputational damage, high reactive maintenance costs, and inability to forecast and prevent issues.\\n\\nWhat I Built: I developed an enterprise-grade scalable pipeline handling IoT telemetry via Azure Event Hub and Function Apps. I built Terraform-managed infrastructure optimized for traffic bursts up to 1000 messages per minute while keeping costs efficient during normal operations. I implemented comprehensive data quality management with automated alerts on anomalies or system failures. This enabled real-time monitoring and proactive issue detection through immediate notifications on potential emergencies.\\n\\nThe Impact: The system successfully handles bursts up to 1000 messages/minute, enabled continuous 24/7 automated monitoring, detects potential issues before failures occur, provides immediate notifications allowing rapid response, automated data quality management catches data issues preventing false alerts, proactive monitoring reduces unplanned outages, reduced emergency response time from hours to minutes, high availability ensures continuous operation, and serverless architecture optimizes operational costs.\\n\\nQ: What IoT project did Margot build? A: Real-time telemetry platform for Dutch water management\\nQ: What throughput can Margot's IoT system handle?

All communications and documentation were in Dutch.\\n\\nThe Business Problem: Major Dutch industrial clients had vast SharePoint libraries containing 100 to 3000 technical documents per domain. Engineers were spending hours manually searching through entire repositories to find specific information. Critical knowledge was buried in lengthy technical documents, making information retrieval painfully slow and inefficient. Engineering teams were wasting hours on document searches, project timelines were delayed due to information bottlenecks, there was risk of using outdated technical documentation, reduced productivity across departments, difficulty onboarding new employees, and lost institutional knowledge when people left.\\n\\nWhat I Built: I built a comprehensive GPT-based knowledge retrieval system that lets users instantly query SharePoint libraries. I created an internal QA system with more than 30 isolated RAG flows, each serving a specific domain with appropriate security and access controls. I automated the entire document ingestion pipeline from SharePoint to vector database (Pgvector), supporting daily updates across multiple domains. I used Terraform to enable rapid provisioning of new knowledge domains.\\n\\nThe Impact: Information retrieval speed reduced from hours to seconds (100x improvement). The system has 300 weekly active users across 30+ domains, showing strong adoption and clear business value. Engineers save multiple hours per week, there's no more manual searches through entire repositories, knowledge access is democratized across the organization, onboarding time is reduced for new employees, and daily updates ensure the latest information is always available.\\n\\nQ: What was Margot's biggest project?

I'm energized by the challenge of taking complex, interconnected components and uncovering how they interact, where inefficiencies exist, and how they can be optimized to deliver greater value. For me, the most fulfilling aspect of my work isn't simply implementing solutions - it's truly comprehending the entire ecosystem in which they operate. I find genuine satisfaction in diving into engineering challenges, understanding data flows, system architectures, business processes, and user needs to build solutions that are not just functional, but elegant and efficient.\\n\\nThis curiosity extends beyond the technical. I believe that understanding how systems work means understanding the people who use them, the business context that drives them, and the organizational workflows they support. I approach every project with questions: Why does this matter? How do the pieces fit together? Where can we create the most impact?\\n\\nQ: What motivates Margot? A: Understanding how systems work deeply, building efficient solutions, collaborating with people\\nQ: What drives Margot professionally? A: Curiosity about systems, creating value through elegant solutions, genuine human connection\\nQ: What is Margot's approach to ML engineering?

I take pride in building infrastructure that doesn't just solve today's problem but can evolve with changing business needs and growing demands. For me, efficiency means more than performance metrics - it means solutions that are maintainable, reliable, and valuable over time.\\n\\nI approach system design with a holistic mindset, considering not only immediate requirements but also long-term implications. This manifests in my focus on automation, infrastructure as code (Terraform is something I use extensively), robust data pipelines, and monitoring systems that ensure solutions continue delivering value long after deployment. Creating efficient systems is both an intellectual challenge and a source of professional satisfaction. I genuinely enjoy the iterative process of identifying bottlenecks, testing improvements, and refining architectures to achieve optimal performance while maintaining practical sustainability.\\n\\nI take pride in building systems that endure. Knowing that infrastructure I designed continues operating reliably, that pipelines I automated still run smoothly, or that models I deployed continue delivering accurate predictions brings lasting satisfaction. I value the craftsmanship of building systems properly - with thoughtful architecture, comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and maintainable code. Creating solutions that others can understand, operate, and extend is professionally gratifying.\\n\\nQ: How does Margot approach system design? A: Holistic mindset considering long-term sustainability and maintainability\\nQ: What does efficiency mean to Margot? A: Maintainable, reliable, valuable over time, not just performance metrics\\nQ: Does Margot focus on short-term solutions? A: No, builds for evolution and long-term value\\nQ: What brings Margot satisfaction in building systems? A: Creating elegant, efficient, enduring solutions that others can maintain\\n================================================================================\\n\\n================================================================================\\nCHUNK_03_COLLABORATION_AND_WORKING_WITH_PEOPLE\\n================================================================================\\nMargot's Collaborative Approach and Communication Style\\n\\nWhat really distinguishes my approach is my genuine enjoyment of working with people.

A: No, builds for evolution and long-term value\\nQ: What brings Margot satisfaction in building systems? A: Creating elegant, efficient, enduring solutions that others can maintain\\n================================================================================\\n\\n================================================================================\\nCHUNK_03_COLLABORATION_AND_WORKING_WITH_PEOPLE\\n================================================================================\\nMargot's Collaborative Approach and Communication Style\\n\\nWhat really distinguishes my approach is my genuine enjoyment of working with people. I believe that the best solutions are never built in isolation, but emerge from collaboration, dialogue, and shared understanding between technical and business teams. Working with people isn't just a necessary part of my role - it's genuinely enjoyable and motivating.\\n\\nI value communication as a core engineering skill, not an ancillary responsibility. I find satisfaction in translating complex technical concepts for business stakeholders, understanding user needs through conversation, and building consensus around solution approaches. Regular presentations, clear documentation, and ongoing stakeholder engagement aren't burdens to me - they're integral parts of delivering successful projects.\\n\\nMy experience working entirely in Dutch with major organizations like ProRail and Dutch water management authorities has reinforced this collaborative philosophy. I've learned that taking time to understand cultural context, organizational dynamics, and individual stakeholder concerns leads to solutions that are not just technically excellent but genuinely useful and adopted by end users. I thrive in environments where I can work closely with diverse teams - data analysts, software engineers, business users, and decision-makers - bringing different perspectives together to solve complex problems.\\n\\nI value the relationships built through projects, the insights gained from diverse perspectives, and the shared satisfaction of successful delivery. I find fulfillment in helping others succeed through my work - enabling analysts to focus on strategic work instead of data wrangling, empowering business users with self-service insights, or providing engineers with tools that make their jobs easier.\\n\\nQ: Does Margot enjoy working with people? A: Yes, genuinely enjoys collaboration and finds it motivating\\nQ: How does Margot view communication? A: Core engineering skill, not ancillary responsibility\\nQ: Can Margot work with non-technical stakeholders? A: Yes, excels at translating technical concepts and building consensus\\nQ: What is Margot's working style? A: Collaborative, communicative, focused on relationships and shared understanding\\nQ: Does Margot present to stakeholders? A: Yes, regular presentations and documentation are integral to her work\\n================================================================================\\n\\n================================================================================\\nCHUNK_04_OWNERSHIP_RESULTS_AND_BUSINESS_FOCUS\\n================================================================================\\nEnd-to-End Ownership and Focus on Business Impact\\n\\nI take pride in providing complete ownership of solutions from conception to production. I believe that true ownership means responsibility for the entire lifecycle - understanding the business problem, exploring and validating data, designing architecture, building models, deploying systems, and ensuring they continue delivering value. This comprehensive ownership approach allows me to anticipate challenges, optimize for real-world constraints, and deliver solutions that work in practice, not just in theory.\\n\\nFor me, ownership also means accountability. I take responsibility for outcomes, actively monitor system performance, respond to issues, and continuously seek opportunities to improve solutions. I view feedback as valuable input for refinement rather than criticism.\\n\\nWhile I possess deep technical expertise, I maintain unwavering focus on business outcomes. I believe that combining machine learning and statistics provides organizations with solid answers to their questions, but only when implemented with clear understanding of business objectives. For every technical decision, I ask: What business value does this create? How does this support organizational goals? What tangible outcomes will stakeholders see?\\n\\nThis results-oriented mindset ensures that my work translates into action, whether through regularly updated dashboards, automated decision systems,

I'm knowledgeable in optimizing and updating existing models for new requirements, followed by seamless integration into organizational infrastructure. My communicative style ensures that all stakeholders understand progress, challenges, and outcomes throughout the project lifecycle.\\n\\nMy working style is highly involved and communicative. I engage actively with all aspects of projects - from initial requirements gathering to data exploration, from architecture decisions to user training. I believe that staying close to both the data and the people ensures solutions remain grounded in reality. Being involved means more than attending meetings - I actively seek to understand stakeholder concerns, provide insights from data exploration, flag potential issues early, and collaborate on solution refinement. I bring technical expertise into business discussions and business context into technical decisions.\\n\\nMy philosophy emphasizes staying close to both data and business. I work closely with business-oriented colleagues to translate business goals into achievable objectives using models while maintaining technical rigor and data integrity. This balanced approach allows me to bridge technical and business worlds effectively.\\n\\nQ: How does Margot work day-to-day?

      "\n",
      "As a results-oriented Data Scientist, I believe that combining Machine Learning and Statistics provides businesses with solid answers to their questions. While staying close to the data, I work closely with my business-oriented colleagues to translate business goals into achievable objectives using models.\n",
      "\n",
      "My focus is on customer and financial analytics, where I assist in improving marketing strategies with a better understanding of customers’ preferences and measuring the effectiveness of promotion with sales prediction. \n",
      "\n",
      "The outcomes of my work are often presented as regularly updated dashboards and sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "My expertise encompasses the full pipeline delivery, from extracting raw data from the warehouse and creating datasets to tuning models and automating updates. Since data investigation and model tuning are iterative processes, I regularly present my findings and progress using clear and concise slides. Knowledgeable in optimizing and updating old models for new requirements, followed by integration into the client’s infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I do love Data Science because the process of brainstorming new data is quite fun.\n",
      "I see the DS work as an endless process of testing your own ideas. Of course, there are know-how and\n",
      "common approaches, but you still must think and improvise to get better results.\n",
      "That is why data scientist in consulting is a perfect match for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently I live in Amsterdam, while working remotely. I have Netherlands residence permit, so i don’t need to make\n",
      "any additional paperwork to work in Netherlands\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation system\n",
      " \n",
      " I developed a multi-channel recommendation system for a large pharmaceutical client to optimize marketing strategies across 4 communication channels: email, WhatsApp, call-center, and in-person meetings. \n",
      "Four separate ML models were created, each required an individual business approach to define what constituted a successful communication. I handled the project end-to-end - from extracting data from client databases, to creating and scheduling Boosting (LightGBM) models in Airflow, and delivering results back to the client’s systems. Models were updated monthly. \n",
